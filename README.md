# GroundTruths #
    A Folder containing all 10 paths per map generated labeled map_xpath_y

# Maps #
    A Folder containing all maps generated labeled 1-10

# mapGeneration.py #
    Used to generate maps and ground truth paths in /Maps and /GroundTruths

# simulation.py #
    Visualization program to show heatmaps every iteration of the filtering algorithm

    How to run:
        1) Install tkinter with pip install:
                pip install tk

        2) Run simulation.py

        3) Select the number of iterations to be computed 1-100

        4) Select the map file you want to perform filtering on

        5) Selecting time between steps will increase by the second the interval
            between filtering step computations. We reccomend leaving this at 0.

        6) Click Load map and the simulation will run.
            You can scroll with scroll wheel while it's running to view more of the map.
